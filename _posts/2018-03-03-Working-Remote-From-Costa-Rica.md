Currently writing this from Casa Solar in the Fuente Verde Ecovillage in Tinamaste, Costa Rica. I am here until the 8th of March, my journey began on the 4th of February. So much gratitude for this trip. I am a digital nomad from Portland, Oregon, and my life's greatest journey begins here.

On this trip I've learned what I am capable of doing, I've crossed a boundary I can never come back from. Working abroad unlocks so many possibilities for experience, and it still allows you to save money. My current "office" overlooks the rainforest, the sound of bugs, birds, and monkeys are audible all day. The space I've been staying in has a large movement studio that allows me to stretch and be active at any point of the day. I am fed a vegetarian meal by the hosts once or twice a day and can walk a few meters down the road to a water hole complete with its own waterfall which is perfect for cooling off during the day.

Up in the mountains life is simple. The chaos and negative energy of the city are nonexistent, overindulging is next to nearly impossible, and the way these mountain valleys heal your soul is palpable.

My experience started in October of 2017 when I started my remote job. I tell people that I'm a cartographer--I make maps and write programs for collecting comments on policy and planning of National Forests in the United States on contract. It's a pretty niche job, and the work always varies from product to product and client to client. The work is very fun and rewarding.

I decided shortly after I got the job to buy a plane ticket to Costa Rica. I used a mixture of flights.google.com and momondo.com to find the best days to travel and the cheapest prices. I ended up getting a round trip ticket from PDX to LIR for $450. Both sites are good for showing you the cheapest days to fly, and if you can be flexible as to what days it makes it even easier to find a cheap flight.

When the day came I packed as light as possible and left for LIR. Upon arrival I was pretty lucky to have an expat my uncle knew in the area pick me up at the airport and drop me off at a place I stayed at in Playas del Coco for a few weeks while I got my bearings. I learned that most places in CR have free Wi-Fi from the hostels to the local Sodas, which are small family owned restaurants that serve cheap typical local food such as Gallo Pinto or Casados. Plays del Coco is close to LIR, but there isn't really anything that spectacular about the area. It's a pretty typical beach in a pretty typical town where apparently a lot of expats come and stay.

After I delivered my first serious product to my client I decided to take a weekend and hop on the bus to Monteverde and experience what the country has to offer. When traveling the country you can use thebusschedule.com to find pretty reliable times that the busses leave and you can use maps.me which is a great application for downloading a local map to your phone. The maps usually have important bus stops, hostels, places to eat, trails, and attractions.

When taking the bus it's important to catch a bus that leaves early enough to catch your transfers. For instance, there are only two buses up the mountain to Monteverede and they both leave from La Irma, one at 10am and the other at 3pm. The bus from Playas del Coco takes you to Pulmatin de Liberia where you can catch a connecting bus to San Jose and get off at La Irma to go up to Monteverde.

Monteverde was much cooler in temperature than the beach, being that it was up in the mountains, which was a nice change. Monteverde is a unique village with delicious coffee, food, and souvenir shops. I stayed at the Hostel la Suerta B&B for about $10 a night and would highly recommend it to a friend. From the hostel it's easy to book different tours, which will pick you up right outside the hostel. I booked a tour of the rainforest for one of the days I stayed and went with a group other travelers staying at the hostel.

After my stay in Monteverede I went back to Plays del Coco to gather my things. During my stay in Coco I met a Tica who knew Costa Rica very well and had a vehicle. We ended up traveling together to Montezuma, Santa Teresa, and Malpaís for some camping and adventuring. Each place having it's own drastically unique village, beaches, people, and natural attractions. In Montezuma we met a couple from Argentina who ended up traveling with us. The first night in Montezuma it was a full moon, laying on the beach under the stars that night was a major highlight of my trip. Cancer, Gemini, Orion, Canis Major, Ursa Major, Pleiades, the Milky Way (Vía Láctea en Español), and other constellations lit up the night sky. While looking at the sky and the ocean Ivan and I sang "We all live in the milky, milky, way" to the tune of Yellow Submarine.
