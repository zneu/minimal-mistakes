Currently writing this from Casa Solar in the Fuente Verde Ecovillage in Tinamaste, Costa Rica. I am here until the 8th of March, my journey began on the 4th of February. So much gratitude for this trip. I am a digital nomad from Portland, Oregon, and my life's greatest journey begins here. In this blog post you will read how I was able to spend 5 weeks in Costa Rica and still work, find some tricks for working and/or traveling in Costa Rica, and read about the life changing experiences I had. I hope this post inspires you and gives you some great ideas for getting out of your comfort zone and traveling to another country.

On this trip I've learned what I am capable of doing, I've crossed a boundary I can never come back from. I've experienced, learned, and grown so much. Working abroad has unlocked so many possibilities for new experiences by allowing me to save money and travel. My current "office" overlooks the rainforest. The sound of bugs, birds, and monkeys are audible all day. The space I've been staying in has a large movement studio that allows me to stretch and be active at any point of the day. I am fed a vegetarian meal by the hosts once or twice a day and can walk a few meters down the road to a water hole complete with its own waterfall perfect for cooling off during the day. Up in the mountains life is simple. The chaos and negative energy of the city are nonexistent, overindulging is next to nearly impossible, and the way these mountain valleys heal your soul is palpable.

My experience started in October of 2017 when I started my remote job. I tell people that I'm a cartographer--I make maps and write programs for collecting comments on policy and planning of National Forests in the United States on a contract. It's a pretty niche job, and the work always varies from product to product and client to client. The work is very fun and rewarding.

I decided shortly after I got the job to buy a plane ticket to Costa Rica for 5 weeks. I used a mixture of flights.google.com and momondo.com to find the best days to travel and the cheapest prices. I ended up getting a round trip ticket from PDX to LIR for around $450. Both sites are good for showing you the cheapest days to fly, and if you can be flexible as to what day you travel it makes it even easier to find a cheap flight.

When the day came I packed as light as possible and left for LIR. Upon arrival I was pretty lucky to have an expat my uncle knew in the area pick me up at the airport and drop me off at the place I lived at in Playas del Coco for a few weeks while I got my bearings. While in Coco I learned that most places in CR have free Wi-Fi such as the hostels and the local Sodas. Sodas are small family owned restaurants that serve cheap typical local food such as Gallo Pinto or Casados. You can also get a Kolbi sim card just about anywhere for about $4--usually you'll find a sign out front with the Kolbi symbol--and can load it with as much money as you'd like. I found that $20 which lasted me for an entire month while texting or calling locally and using internet in moderation. The nice thing about Coco is that it's the closest beach to a main airport and it's relatively easy to get to, but there isn't anything that spectacular about the area. It's a pretty typical beach in a pretty typical town where a lot of expats live.

The first week I was in Coco I spent my time getting acquainted with the country's culture, monetary system, and the layout of the town. I got my sim card, pulled out cash from Banco de Costa Rica (BCR), and found my favorite places to work during the day. At the end of my first week I delivered my first serious products to my client and I decided to hop on a bus and take a weekend up in the mountains in Monteverde.

When traveling across Costa Rica you can use thebusschedule.com to find reliable bus times and maps.me--an application that downloads a lightweight local map to your phone--to find important bus stops, hostels, places to eat, trails, and attractions. When taking the bus it's important to catch one that leaves early enough to make the transfers to your location. For instance, there are only two buses up the mountain to Monteverede and they both leave from La Irma, one at 10 am and the other at 3 pm. The bus from Coco took me to Pulmatin de Liberia where I can caught a connecting bus to San Jose and got off at La Irma to go up to Monteverde.

Monteverde is a unique mountain village surrounded by rainforest with delicious coffee (grown locally) and food, souvenir shops, and its own unique natural attractions. Monteverde was much cooler in temperature than the beach, being that it was up in the mountains, which was a nice change. I stayed at Hostel la Suerta B&B for about $10 a night and would highly recommend it to a friend. From the hostel it's easy to book different tours of the area, which will pick you up and drop you off right outside the hostel. A few of the us at the hostel booked a tour of the Monteverde cloudforest which was a really great experience. After our tour one of the friends we made, who had been staying at the hostel, took us up the road to a local spot where you can climb up the inside of a hollowed out tree about 10 stories to the top.

Sitting at the top I realized that traveling is like being high up in a tree. When you're on it, cradled within it's arms, it's exhilarating. You could easily fall at any moment to the depths of the jungle floor below. But then you realize that you're in a tree, it has strength and so do you. The tree spoke to me and said,

"I am a strong tree, be calm and still with me,
I will keep you safe from your enemies.
If you find grounding this high in the tranquil sky
then you can glisten like the sunset on the clouds.
Your love will bring much warmth to those who see your everlasting beauty.
So ground with me for an eternity."

During my stay in Coco I met a Tica who knew Costa Rica very well and had a vehicle. We ended up traveling together to Montezuma, Santa Teresa, and Malpaís for some camping and adventuring. Each place having it's own drastically unique village, beaches, people, and natural attractions. In Montezuma we met a couple from Argentina who ended up traveling with us. The first night in Montezuma it was a full moon, laying on the beach under the stars that night was a major highlight of my trip. Cancer, Gemini, Orion, Canis Major, Ursa Major, Ursa Minor, Pleiades, the Milky Way (Vía Láctea en Español), and other constellations lit up the night sky. While looking at the sky and the ocean Ivan and I sang "We all live in the milky, milky, way" to the tune of Yellow Submarine. The following day we hiked from our hostel to the Montezuma Waterfall. The hike takes you right up the Montezuma river to a waterfall close to 10 stories high. We jumped off cliffs into the waters below and swam around the waterfall for the greater part of the day. When we were finished we hiked back, got in the car, and drove to Santa Teresa.

Santa Teresa can be described as a hippie, yogi, surfer's paradise. In Santa Teresa the beach is long, surf's always up, and the sunsets are brilliant. The town has vegan restaurants, coffee shops, yoga, and spa services. Most of the people I talked with said they showed up and had been there for months since. We camped at a spot on the beach and cooked our meals in a kitchen, with running water, where the stove was pretty much a raised fire pit. The only caveat was that the restrooms didn't have toilet paper, nor did we. I went to a vegan breakfast restaurant to eat (and to do my daily duty), but I returned to find out we had been kicked out of the camping spot because my Argentinian friend's accent came off as aggressive when he asked the camp host for some teepee. One of my biggest regrets on this trip was not having the time to surf while in Santa Teresa, but I know that the next time I am in Costa Rica I will be making a plan to spend at least a week there.

Our next stop was Malpaís where we found another camping spot on the coast. The beach here was a more rocky, with lots of shells, and the tides were a little more calm. The camping spot we stayed at also had a kitchen, complete with a blender, where we made Piña Colodas with fresh pineapple and rum. Our stop here was very relaxing. The camp host was very nice, he had a hobby of collecting and polishing rocks. He gave the four of us a piece of black tourmaline that he had found and polished. We sat around playing steel drums and hand pans before we left to go back up towards Playa del Coco. On our way up we stoped at Playa Negra and Tamarindo to catch an amazing sunset. Tamarindo is a bit more of a touristy spot. There is a downtown with some really nice shopping and restaurants, the store at the beginning of town reminds me of a health food store in the US. The sunsets are incredible, the beach is full of lively people, and at night there's always something to do. There is live music everywhere and on the beach you can catch some amazing fire spinners.

After my journey with my traveling partners I met up with a friend from the US who flew into Liberia. Her and I traveled together for two days to get down to Manuel Antonio, where we stayed one night, and eventually to Uvita for Envision. While in Manuel Antonio we stopped at BCR so she could pull out cash. We waited in line, got to the banker, and there ended up being an issue where there "systems were down". They ended up taking $800 dollars out of her account, didn't provide us with any Colones, and couldn't reverse the transaction. They told us that her bank had to reverse the transaction. Long story short.. if you need cash just pull it out of an ATM--they have a 250,000₡ limit so don't try to go over or it might take your card which is another hassle. Fortunately the charges dropped after a week and my friend was able to get her bank to give her a temporary credit for one of the charges. Manuel Antonio is another fairly touristy location, but it has a decent beach, and a National Park which we didn't visit.

Fortunately we found someone going to Envision who picked us up in Manuel Antonio with their rental car. That was a huge blessing while traveling to Envision, otherwise we may have had to hike quite a ways down the highway to get to the festival and would've had to pay to get a taxi to take us to town for groceries. If I go another year I will definitely plan a few months ahead to find a place to stay in Uvita before and after the festival and an easy way to the entrance. I may even plan with some other people going to rent a bigger house and to go in on a car rental.

Once we got to Envision the orchestrated, beautiful, chaos began. I can't put everything that happened at Envision into perspective. You'll have to go and experience Envision for yourself if you're called, and I would highly recommend it. The music, workshops, and people are all very inspiring and there are so many opportunities to learn. So many highlights and so many big life lessons. Seeing Xavier Rudd on the main stage with quite a few good friends from the US was a huge highlight of my experience. Singing medicine songs in the Red Tent, the Tea Lounge, on the beach, and experiencing my first sound healing changed my perspective on music. Music is so healing, it can be a very strong medicine. One of the songs that I learned and will never forget goes like this...

"I am a wise woman,
I am a caring woman,
I am a healer and my soul will never die.

I honor you I empower you to be who you are,
I honor you I empower you to be who you are.

I am a strong man,
I am a loving man,
I am a peacemaker my soul will never die.

I honor you I empower you to be who you are,
I honor you I empower you to be who you are."

The women sing, the men echo, and vice versa. What a powerful song to unite the divine feminine and masculine.

Another highlight of Envision were the magnificent sunsets on the beach. Witnessing celestial events with large groups of people has been a common theme of my life since the Global Eclipse Gathering in Oregon... which is another story for another day. There's nothing like cheering on the universe with thousands of other people as the sun, earth, moon, and starts do their magnificent work of just being.

Big shout out to the medics/village witches, sacred fire tenders, and the Red Tent and Unity Temple healers at Envision. Of course a big shoutout to everyone else who helped to put on such a magnificent experience for so many people, but, for me, especially to the people who held space for healing and learning for the entire weekend. Incredible and inspiring people, I look up to you.

After Envision we were invited up to Casa Solar where I started writing this post. At Casa Solar I was able to decompress and unpack everything I learned while on this trip. Even in this post I can't capture every moment and every experience, but I do my best to relate some of the lessons and part of the journey. Casa Solar, in Fuente Verde, was such a beautiful experience. So much gratitude. I stayed here for a solid week, it was that amazing. The most remarkable part of my stay at Casa Solar happened on my last night there.

Temazcal is a type of sweat lodge which originated with pre-Hispanic Indigenous peoples in Mesoamerica. In ancient Mesoamerica it was part of a curative ceremony thought to purify the body after exertion such as battle. It was also used for healing the sick, improving health, and for women to give birth. Temazcal is a permanent structure at Casa Solar, it is a dome shaped lodge that you cannot stand up in, and have to crawl into. The ceremony began by lighting a big fire with big stones located in the center. 40 or more people gathered around this fire to participate in some way. At the beginning of the ceremony everyone was thoroughly smudged and we all threw a piece of tobacco into the fire to open the ceremony. We were told to say Ōmeteōtl when speaking/asking a question to the leader of our ceremony. Ōmeteōtl is a name used to refer to the pair of Aztec deities Ometecuhtli and Omecihuatl. "Ōme" translates as "two" or "dual" in Nahuatl and teōtl translates as "god". The tobacco represented our intention and our goal going into the Temazcal, this intention was something to keep us strong while inside. We also set a group intention of community love.

When the stones were ready and everyone was smudged 40 of us entered one by one kissing the ground and saying "for all my relations" to remind us that the Temazcal help us to heal all of our relationships. We squished into two rows, one in the back and one in the front around a pit. We passed around copal, a bouquet of plants, and two large antlers and connected with them on a spiritual level. Shortly after stones from the fire were brought into the Temazcal one by one and we said Ōmeteōtl as each was grabbed by the two large antlers and placed in the pit in the center. Copal was rubbed on the stones, for circulation and health. The bouquet was hung and was to meant to alleviate us from the pain in our bodies. Once the stones were placed, the door of the Temazcal was shut, pitch darkness engulfed us, and we were in the womb of mother earth. Our guide splashed water, mixed with healing herbs, on the stones and said prayers for our mother earth in which we responded with Aho which is Cherokee for amen. In between prayers we sang three songs and at the end of the third song the first door was opened (out of four) and more stones were brought in and we repeated the above. At this point people were crouched with their faces on the ground and for me this is when my hands went numb and I stated to feel the intense heat. This process went on for two more doors and on the third door we drank water and opened a back door as well. On the final door, the fire door, a lot of water was poured onto the stones and we were reminded of death and the after life. We said a prayer to our ancestors and the grandmother in the Temazcal said a word of thanks for our prayers to mother earth.

When the final door was open we crawled out and experienced much relief, and gratitude for life. This experience made me aware of how precious life is and about how uncomfortable life can be. It also made me aware of the things that I cherish in life and that I need to continue to pursue those things with all of my strength. I am hear to be of service to the world and to the people around me and to continue to be a shining light in darkness. To be a light you must face your darkness and to be light there must be darkness. At the end of the ceremony we stood in a circle, threw more tobacco into the fire to close the ceremony. One by one we looked at the person next to us and said, "Yo soy tu," in which they responded, "Tu eres yo," which means "I am you, you are me", until we made it all the way around the circle.

I realized on this journey how connected I am to my path, my source, my pure light.. Pura Vida! How taken care of I am in life, and on this journey while being so far away from everything that is familiar and comfortable to me. I didn't speak Spanish upon arrival, but learned quickly and was able to navigate my way around the country. I learned, and am continuing to learn, to love unconditionally, speak positively, and to be courteous to those who come into my path.

You never know who you might meet, and you never know how cosmic life can be until you surrender completely to your heart and your path. When you surrender you will be abundantly taken care of. If you realize that the waves of life with its ups and downs are nothing but gifts, you can make it through everything you're faced with and take it as a lesson. Align to God within and your heart will swell and overflow. Speak the communal language of love, known to all who cross your path. Oxytocin floods your system, adrenalin to keep you alert, serotonin overwhelms, and the cosmos within you beautifully aligns to the cosmos outside you. Even animals are curious of this profound existence which can be lived internally for eternity regardless of what goes on outside. Naked and robbed in an unknown world, and pure love can still help you to find your way back home, to source and beyond.

So much Love and so much gratitude for this trip. Tears of joy sweep over me. Thank you for reading this and I hope it can inspire the fire within you to be open to your path and to listen intently to your heart.
