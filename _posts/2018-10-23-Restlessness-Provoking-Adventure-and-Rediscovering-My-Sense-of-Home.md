## Foggy Mornings, a Cup of Coffee, and New Beginnings
Today I am sitting in a coffee shop down the road from my house trying to focus
on my work. It can be difficult being a contractor and working remote.
It's like being your own boss but not working on the projects that you want to be
working on. It's hard to juggle work with a social life and the many projects that
I involve myself in. I would much rather be working on my van build or recording music
than entering legal documents into a database. The pay is great and many people
would kill to have my job, yet I am unsatisfied. It's October in Oregon and the
weather is reflecting the change of season. Cold temperatures and foggy
mornings are now the norm. The change in weather contributes to my change in mood
and energy. When Fall comes I usually find myself much more creative as I am
home more often. This Fall I've found myself with less energy than usual, but I know
there are other factors contributing to my overall energy then the weather.
My sense of place and ground hasn't been very strong the last year.
I've experienced many struggles since moving into Portland, mostly related to
my living situation, but have also accomplished many of my goals and intentions
for moving here.

## Struggling to Find Sanctuary and Grounded-ness in The City
I graduated in March of 2017 and was hired in October of 2017, making this October
my 1 year anniversary with the company I am working for. I moved into Portland
in June of 2017 and have lived in 3 homes since. I initially moved to Portland
to fulfill dreams of being a musician. I wanted to connect with people in Portland
who are doing the same thing. Since then I have started a band and have gained some
reputation in the city with some of the local event producers. I've played some
big shows and have had a great time connecting with the Portland scene, but I've
had such a difficult time with finding a place to live that satisfies all of my
needs.

I was living in a Bachelor pad with some friends at the time of my graduation.
Being 4 boys in our early twenties the house was pretty trashy,
but being that we were musicians in similar places in life we understood each other,
making the best of what we had. I got the news in April that our landlord was
planning to sell the house and we were going to have to leave.
I took the opportunity to find a home in Portland. The house I found was small,
maybe 700 sq. ft., and wasn't designed for two roommates,
but rather for the landlords parents to move into when they retired. I
didn't last in that house longer than 5 months. My roommate ended up
loosing their cat, their job, and their bike in a matter of a month and
took their aggression out on me. I ended up rushing out and into another
place, this time with two girls. The Landlord lived next door and had a lease agreement
that should've scared anyone off, but I knew I'd be OK as I would follow his strange
rules and keep to myself. The girls promised me space to create music, which was
my reason for moving into the city, but ended up telling me I couldn't play in
the house anymore only after a month or two. The energy in that house was so
strange--the house was at least 100 years old and was most likely haunted. I was
at a friends party when my intuition told me to ask around to see if anyone knew
of a housing opportunity. One of the people attending the party told me of a house
in the area that was looking for a 4th. This house, being my current place of
residence has 3 other guys. One of the original roommates moved out and was replaced by
my current roommates brother, whom has turned out to be quite aggressive as he is
going through a hard time in his life. I understand where he is coming from
but the situation has once again escalated to the point where I need to find something
else.

## TL;DR: Lessons Learned and New Adventure Awaits
Not having a sanctuary to ground myself in the city has been difficult for me,
but it's made me a better human in the long run. Through the process of moving around
the city I've realized the things that I need and don't need in my life and have
downsized considerably. I know myself more intimately and the things I vibe with and the things I don't. I have learned to keep my cool under pressure and to continue to come
from a place of love even when others are acting aggressively towards me. I've
learned that it's better to be uncomfortable than resentful. I've been forced
to realize what makes my space grounding and healing. I've realized how important it
is for me to live with people who share similar values and who want to spend time
together as community. I've learned how important it is to separate sleep, work,
and creativity from one another. When I try to sleep or create music and work in
the same room I associate that room with two conflicting energies.
For instance, working and playing music in the same room associates making music
with work or makes it hard to work because I just want to play.
Working in the same room I sleep in makes it hard to ground and meditate in that
space because I associate it with working.

Although I've had a somewhat difficult time in Portland I've made the absolute
best of it. I graduated, moved to the city, started working remotely, established
myself in a variety of communities, started my dream band, and accomplished a variety
of other things. Despite hardship, I am very grateful for the support I've had from  
the communities I've found myself a part of. These interactions have shaped who
I am and have helped me to discover new things to pursue in my journey. Since I've
lived in Oregon my whole life, and have experienced what the city has to offer,
I am feeling a need to travel away from here for an extended length of time. Besides,
I am over the cold winters (for now) and want some warm sunny beaches in my life. I've decided that building a van and moving into it is how I'm going to rediscover myself and my sense of home. California, here I come! Yosemite, The Bay, SLO, and San Diego await. Post adventures in CA I plan to travel the four corners and continue on to The South. After traveling the states for a while, and using this blog to document my path, I plan to ground down again in a sanctuary that fosters focus, creativity, spiritual and physical wellness,
and community.
