### Tufte’s principles of graphic excellence

- “Graphical excellence is the well-designed presentation of interesting data -- a matter of substance, of statistics, and of design.

- Graphical excellence consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision, and efficiency.

- Graphical excellence is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space.

- Graphical excellence is nearly always multivariate.
And graphical excellence requires telling the truth about the data.”
