### Tufte’s principles of graphic excellence

“Graphical excellence is the well-designed presentation of interesting data -- a matter of substance, of statistics, and of design.
Graphical excellence consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision, and efficiency.
Graphical excellence is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space.
Graphical excellence is nearly always multivariate.
And graphical excellence requires telling the truth about the data.”
