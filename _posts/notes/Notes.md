- Array, JS pulls up one quote,

"Any time you introduce a new idea into the world there is bound to be
somebody who dislikes it. If you aren't being rejected you probably aren't
doing anything new. In fact, look at rejection in another way... rejection
is just another option to keep moving on. Every time you see a rejection
turn it into an invitation to keep going. Create an opportunity to persevere,
to keep going forward." - Joe Gebbia

"Spot an opportunity, come up with an original solution, and then tracking
the hardest step of putting something into the world, trying something, putting
your idea into the world. The more you can do that the more you can you spot
the next opportunity." - Joe Gebbia

sw2 + wc = mo
some will love it, some won't plus, who cares, equals, move on.

Keep going until you do find the people that love your idea.
