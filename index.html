<p>
  Currently writing this from Casa Solar in the Fuente Verde Ecovillage in
  Tinamaste, Costa Rica. I am here until the 8th of March, my journey began on
  the 4th of February. So much gratitude for this trip.<br><br>

  I realized on this journey how connected I am to my path, my source, my pure
  light.. Pura Vida! How taken care of I am in life, and taken care of I was on
  this journey while being so far away from everything that is familiar and
  comfortable to me. I didn’t speak Spanish upon arrival, but learned quickly
  and was able to navigate my way around the country. I learned, and am
  continuing to learn, to love unconditionally, speak positively, and to be
  courteous to those who come into my path.<br><br>
